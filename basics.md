#Basic rationality of approach

* We can all help towards creating a better world for everyone. 
* Better world for everyone means - Peace, equality, sustainability, human rights, animal rights etc.
* We all feel pain, joy and everything in between.
* Our feelings and perceptions are created by our brain and body.
* We are all interdependent on each other and nature.
* To help others, we need to be fit enough, both physically and mentally.
* ... to be refined and continued.

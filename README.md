# Revisiting Education

##What:
Open-source attempt at redesigning education for our children.

##Why:
Because we can do this better together.

##How:
Introduce a list of topics conceptually, that we learn during the course of our lives, to be the right things to do for own lives and for overall good. Share your own 'wisdom' by explaining the topic briefly to the kids. They can pursue the topics further on the internet.

For every topic, mention 'what' it is, 'why' it is important, 'how' to be a player in this field.
